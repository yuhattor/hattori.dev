<p>Organization admins and security managers can now enable private vulnerability reporting for all public repositories within an organization at once.</p>
<p>With this enhancement, you no longer have to enable the feature for each repository individually.</p>
<p>Find this option under your organization&#039;s &quot;Settings&quot; tab under &quot;Code security and analysis&quot;.</p>
