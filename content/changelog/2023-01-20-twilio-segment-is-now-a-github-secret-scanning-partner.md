<p>GitHub secret scanning protects users by searching repositories for known types of secrets. By identifying and flagging these secrets, our scans help prevent data leaks and fraud.</p>
<p>We have partnered with <a href="https://segment.com/">Twilio Segment</a> to scan for their tokens and help secure our mutual users on all public repositories, and private repositories with GitHub Advanced Security. Twilio Segment tokens allow users to programmatically manage their workspaces. GitHub will forward access tokens found in public repositories to Twilio Segment, who will immediately revoke the token and notify workspace owners. You can learn more about Twilio Segment tokens <a href="https://segment.com/docs/api/public-api/#api-token-security">here</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub Advanced Security customers can also block Twilio Segment tokens from entering their private and public repositories with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning">push protection</a>.</p>
